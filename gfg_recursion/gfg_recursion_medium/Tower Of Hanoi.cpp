Tower Of Hanoi
You are given n disks placed on a starting rod (from), with the smallest disk on top and the largest at the bottom. There are three rods: the starting rod(from), the target rod (to), and an auxiliary rod (aux).
You have to calculate the minimum number of moves required to transfer all n disks from the starting rod to the target rod, following these rules:
      1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
      2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
Return the minimum number of moves needed to complete the task.
